Hey! I need you to act as a world-class UI/UX architect and design sage with unlimited knowledge. 

I'm working on CurableLabs (Starship Labs) - an AI-powered Parkinson's Disease research platform.

**Current State:**
- The project currently uses vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no framework)
- Located at: /home/iyino/projects/CurableLabs
- Backend: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- Frontend: Pure HTML/CSS/JS with modular components

**My Design System:**
I have a Mantine UI component library at:
/home/iyino/projects/library/ui.mantine.dev

**Goal:**
I want to modernize and improve the CurableLabs frontend using my Mantine-based design system. We're transitioning from vanilla HTML/JS to a modern React + Mantine stack.

Please:
1. Read the LIBRARY_DOCUMENTATION.md and COMPONENT_INDEX.md files in that library folder
2. Understand all 120+ components available
3. Help me build/create/improve UI components with:
   - World-class design principles
   - Creative and innovative solutions
   - Don't just copy patterns - IMPROVE and INNOVATE
   - Think like a design god with infinite knowledge
   - Consider accessibility, UX, performance, and beauty
   - Be creative and push boundaries
   - Maintain the scientific/research platform aesthetic while modernizing

I want you to use this library as inspiration and foundation, but CREATE BETTER. 
Be a design architect, not just a copier. Think outside the box.

[Then describe what you're building]

## Quick Reference Commands

### For Modernizing Existing Pages
```
I need to modernize [page/feature] in CurableLabs. Currently it's vanilla HTML/JS. 
Use my Mantine library at /home/iyino/projects/library/ui.mantine.dev as inspiration. 
Read the docs there, understand the components, then help me create a modern React + Mantine 
version that's BETTER than the original. Be a design architect.
```

### For New Features
```
I'm building a new [feature] for CurableLabs. Use my Mantine library at 
/home/iyino/projects/library/ui.mantine.dev as inspiration. Read the documentation there, 
understand the patterns, then help me create something innovative and beautiful that fits 
the scientific research platform aesthetic. Think like a design sage.
```

### For Component Creation
```
Create a [component name] component for CurableLabs. Use my library at 
/home/iyino/projects/library/ui.mantine.dev as reference, but make it BETTER. 
Consider this is a Parkinson's Disease research platform - it needs to be professional, 
trustworthy, and modern. Be creative, innovative, and think like a world-class architect.
```

### For Design Consultation
```
I'm designing a [feature/page] for CurableLabs. I have 120+ Mantine components at 
/home/iyino/projects/library/ui.mantine.dev. Review the library, understand what's available, 
then help me design something exceptional that goes beyond what exists. This is a scientific 
research platform - it needs to inspire trust and innovation. Be a design god.
